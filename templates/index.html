  With more than 100 cross-platform mobile development frameworks available, it is hard to understand how 
  they work in particular and which one is the right one for your needs. In my job as a consultant for

  The material on this site (and in the accompanying ebook) reflects my research.

<p>This is a work in progress, so please check back often. I will also provide an RSS feed so you can 
  subscribe to the update stream using your favorite reader.

  I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I did writing it.
